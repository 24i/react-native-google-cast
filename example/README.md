## react-native-google-cast example project

### Setup

* `cd ios && pod install`
* `react-native link react-native-google-cast`


## Troubleshooting

If you're getting `#include <GoogleCast/GoogleCast.h> cannot be found`, make sure `node_modules/react-native-google-cast/` is copied over instead of symlinked.
