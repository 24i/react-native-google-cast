## CastVideos-rn

Reference React Native application shows how to cast videos from a device that is fully compliant with the Cast Design Checklist.

The aim of this app is to be a reference implementation just like the [CastVideos sample apps](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/sample-apps).

In addition, this example project demonstrates how to set up and use react-native-google-cast with:

- [react-native-navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation)
- [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)
