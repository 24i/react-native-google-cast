Please refer to the official guides for [Android](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/android_sender/customize_ui) and [iOS](https://developers.google.com/cast/docs/ios_sender/customize_ui). Most of the UI customization is done globally (XML files for Android, in `AppDelegate.m` for iOS), so there's nothing React Native specific.

If you have a use case where you need customization that requires React Native integration (custom buttons on widgets, maybe?), please open an issue.
