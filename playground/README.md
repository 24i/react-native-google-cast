## react-native-google-cast playground

Playground demonstrating the full functionality of the `react-native-google-cast` library. The main purpose of the playground is to provide an app for e2e tests but you can also browse it manually.

Please note that this project uses `package.json` from the parent folder to simplify developing the library while testing it on this example project. If you use `react-native-google-cast` in your own project, please follow instructions in the main [README](../README.md), and understand that the project structure will be slightly different than in this example project.

### Setup
